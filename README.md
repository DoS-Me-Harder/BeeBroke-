Thanks for downloading my code! I have no idea how you found it but I'm glad you did. My name's Astro and I'm the dev of this piece of sh_t code. I hope it works by the time you're reading this. The is my first program that I've made public and put my heart into. Programming has been my passion since I was a kid and now I'm finally working on my dreams. Hopefully someday I'll be a big name in the community but right now I'm willing to stick to small things, like this. I go by *Asutoro | アストロᴮᵉᵗᵃᵥ₁.₀.₀#6666* on Discord. If my name is still that when you're reading this, send me a message and let me know how I did. I hope you'll enjoy using my program!
